## The Problem ChainChat Solves

ChainChat empowers users to interact with smart contracts and access decentralized applications from multiple chains all within a single user interface. This unified experience prevents users from having to switch between various frontends and reduces the risk of interacting with counterfeit or malicious frontends.

By promoting direct interaction with smart contracts, ChainChat also supports the tenet of decentralization. Users can self-host the application, ensuring censorship resistance and removing geolocation-based restrictions that might be imposed by traditional frontends.

## Challenges We Ran Into

No one on our team had prior frontend experience, so building ChainChatâ€™s interface required us to learn an entirely new skill set from scratch. This learning curve introduced hurdles that led to significant refactoring and adjustments as we navigated the new technologies and frameworks involved.
