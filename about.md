### Where I'm from

I was born and raised in Northern Virginia, where an early passion for STEM guided me toward a deep interest in computing. After attending a magnet STEM high school, I channeled that curiosity into exploring the foundations of programming, data analysis, and engineering principles.

### What I do now

I'm currently a Cornell CS Major and an Incoming Software Engineer at Chicago Trading Company. At Cornell, my coursework and research have enabled me to build a strong foundation in computer science theory while applying it to practical, real-world scenarios—ranging from creating intelligent web applications to designing scalable data platforms.

### Skills & Interests

My technical interests lie at the intersection of software engineering, trading infrastructure, and data platform engineering. I’m particularly drawn to:

- **Performance and Scalability:** I enjoy building systems that can handle large volumes of data efficiently, ensuring low latency and reliability—critical traits for trading and financial analytics.
- **Data Engineering & Analytics:** I’m skilled in leveraging Python, SQL, and various ETL frameworks to build robust data pipelines. I appreciate the process of transforming raw data into actionable insights, whether for algorithmic trading or other complex analytics.
- **Machine Learning & AI:** From working with LLMs to developing ML-driven sorting algorithms, I have experience integrating AI into projects. I’m fascinated by the potential of ML and AI to inform decision-making, improve user experiences, and solve intricate optimization problems.
- **Full-Stack Web Development:** I’ve built applications from the ground up using frameworks like Flask and React, integrated APIs, and utilized cloud services. This full-stack exposure helps me understand the entire product lifecycle—from user-facing interfaces to backend databases and services.

### Beyond the Code

While I’m often immersed in code and technical design, I also enjoy following the latest trends in financial markets, reading up on developments in machine learning research, and staying engaged with NFL news (I’m a big fan of the Washington Commanders). Balancing professional growth with personal interests helps keep my perspectives fresh and well-rounded.

I’m excited to continue learning, tackling complex engineering problems, and innovating at the intersection of technology and finance as I start my journey as a Software Engineer at Chicago Trading Company.
