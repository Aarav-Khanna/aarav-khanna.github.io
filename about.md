### Where I'm from

I was born and raised in Northern Virginia, and my journey into programming/CS started early on as I went to a magnet STEM high school.

I kept up good grades, was a big NFL fan, played lots of Fortnite, and at some point fell in love with programming. 

### What I do now

Currently, I'm a Cornell CS Major and an Incoming Software Engineer at Chicago Trading Company.
