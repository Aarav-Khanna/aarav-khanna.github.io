# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, <br/> I'm Aarav Khanna.

### I'm a software engineer with a focus on trading infrastructure & data platform engineering.

### Currently, I'm a Cornell CS Major and an Incoming Software Engineer at [Chicago Trading Company](https://www.chicagotrading.com/).

<br>
I can usually be found in a programming IDE or reading up on the latest sports or finance news.

I'm a big fan of:

- [Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/money-stuff) with Matt Levine
- [Good Morning Football](https://www.nfl.com/network/shows/good-morning-football) for my latest NFL news (I'm a big Commanders Fan)
